Apple devices such as iPhone,iPad and etc, which can use AirPlay to casting device to other screen,but if people want to use this good function,we may should buy apple box, or buy third box which have cracked the protocol.

We have realized the AirPlay,and ios7,ios8,ios9,ios10,and osx is all supported.
